I audited in “Topics in Mathematics and Problem Solving” in the mathematics department. As part of the class, we participated
in the Mathematics Team Selection Exam. I participated in that exam and gained the
highest score among all participants in the Mathematics Department. Unfortunately, since I was not a student of the Mathematics Department, 
I was not allowed to continue the competition as a team member.
