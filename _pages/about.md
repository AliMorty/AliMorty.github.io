I am Ali Mortazavi. I am a Ph.D. student at the CS department at [University of Victoria](http://uvic.ca/) working on online learning under the supervision of [Prof. Nishant Mehta](http://web.uvic.ca/~nmehta/). <br>
Previously, I did my undergrad and master's in the Computer Engineering department of [AmirKabir University of Technology](https://alimorty.github.io//posts/2019-08-03-About-Amirkabir-University-of-Technology/). I also did a summer research internship on [online stochastic matching](https://alimorty.github.io//posts/2019-11-06-Online-Stochastic-Matching/) at [ITCS](http://itcs.shufe.edu.cn/people/) group at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE) under the supervision of [Prof. Nick Gravin](http://itcs.shufe.edu.cn/~gravin/).<br>

RESEARCH INTEREST
======

In general, I am interested in problems in the intersection of learning theory, game theory and algorithms under uncertainty. I'm currently working on "learning under presence of strategic agents", and also some problems in online convex optimization. Basically, as long as there is a nice theoretical question that I can have some progress on it, I’m in! But let’s list my interests here:<br>

* Online Learning
* Algorithmic Game Theory
* Mechanism Design (for social good!)
* Online (Stochastic) Algorithms
