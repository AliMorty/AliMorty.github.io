I am Ali Mortazavi. I have finished my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at [CEIT department](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/home.htm?depurl=computer-engineering&lang=en) of [AmirKabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/). Now, I am studying Game Theory mostly by reading books and watching video lectures and videos of conferences on Algorithmic Game Theory.

> **BSc in Computer Engineering** <br>
> AmirKabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)
> * [CGPA](https://github.com/AliMorty/AliMorty.github.io/raw/master/files/Transcript_Ali_Mortazavi.pdf):   Overall         18.47 / 20 (3.78/4)
> * [Selected courses](https://alimorty.github.io//education/)   19.33 / 20 (4/4) <br>
                                                                  
RESEARCH INTEREST
======
In general, I am interested in mathematics and theoretical computer science. I have experience both in algorithm design and probability and statistics and right now, 
I decided to focus on game theory and mechanism design because first of all, it is theory hence exciting and also because most of the questions that comes to my mind during the day are related to some sort of applications of game theory. (i.e. understanding the selfish agents behavior, find a way to maximize the social welfare and maximizing the fairness, aggregating subjective preferences of a group,   etc.) So my research interests are: <br>
* Algorithmic Game Theory
* Mechanism Design
*	Statistical Machine Learning
