I am Ali Mortazavi. I have finished my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at [CEIT department](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/home.htm?depurl=computer-engineering&lang=en) of [AmirKabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/).
<br> 



EDUCATION
======
> **BSc in Computer Engineering** <br>
> AmirKabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)
> * [CGPA](https://github.com/AliMorty/AliMorty.github.io/raw/master/files/Transcript_Ali_Mortazavi.pdf):   Overall         18.47 / 20 (3.78/4)
> * [Selected courses](https://alimorty.github.io//education/)   19.33 / 20 (4/4) <br>
                                                                  
RESEARCH INTEREST
======
In general, I am interested in using mathematical objects to model a phenomenon and then finding theorem to describe it. I am also interested in finding the relationship between different problems. (e.g. reducing NP-Complete Problems to each other) In particular, I am interested in **learning theory** and **game theory**. Learning theory because I am interested in providing theories about using data, in an uncertain environment, to make an inference about a phenomenon in a precise way. On the other hand, game theory because I like to think about objects (especially humans) as selfish agents in a game, to predict their possible behaviors. I am also interested in designing mechanism to make a guarantee about the behavior of agents. <br>
My research interests are: <br>

*	Statistical Machine Learning 
*	Optimization
*	Sequential Prediction
*	Mechanism Design in Game Theory
