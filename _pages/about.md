I am Ali Mortazavi. I finished my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at CEIT department of [AmirKabir University of Technology](https://alimorty.github.io//posts/2019-08-03-About-Amirkabir-University-of-Technology/) as the third rank in the class. Having an interest in theoretical research, I decided to continue my study in the area of Algorithmic Game Theory. After reading lecture notes and books about Algorithmic Game Theory (which I described [here](https://alimorty.github.io//cv/)), I did a summer research internship [ITCS](http://itcs.shufe.edu.cn/people/) group at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE)  under supervision of Prof. Nick Gravin.<br>
Currently, I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Nick Gravin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g65nv5cAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Zhihao Gavin Tang](http://itcs.shufe.edu.cn/~zhtang/) and my current area of research is [online stochastic matching](https://alimorty.github.io//posts/2019-11-06-Online-Stochastic-Matching/). <br>



 



EDUCATION

RESEARCH INTEREST
======

In general, I am passionate about mathematics and theoretical computer science. I have experience in both algorithm design and probability and statistics in undergrad. After searching for a while, I found Algorithmic Game Theory to be very exciting because firstly, this field is basically theoretical and secondly, most of the questions that come to my mind during the day are related to some sort of applications of game theory. (i.e. understanding the selfish agents’ behavior, finding a way to maximize the social welfare and maximizing the fairness, aggregating subjective preferences of a group, evolutionary equilibria in real life, price of anarchy when people use the best navigation app!-[here is a post about it](https://alimorty.github.io//posts/2019-08-12-Baraess-Paradox-and-Smartphone-Navigator-Applications/), etc.) <br>
As long as there is a nice theoretical question that I can do some progress on it, I’m in! But let’s list my interests here:<br>

* Algorithmic Game Theory
* Online (Stochastic) Algorithms (**currently doing research on it**)
* Mechanism Design
* Online Learning
