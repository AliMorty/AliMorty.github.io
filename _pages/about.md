I am Ali Mortazavi. I have finished my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at [CEIT department](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/home.htm?depurl=computer-engineering&lang=en) of [AmirKabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/).

RESEARCH INTEREST
======
In general, I am interested in applied mathematics, probability and statistics. 
I like to study how a human can **understand concepts** and how we can **encode knowledge** in computers so they can infer like a human. Now, with the growth of Deep Learning Systems, I am really interested in understanding what **really** Deep Neural Networks learn! 
I am also interested in how we can develop a **mechanism** to guarantee that computers will be safe for human species. <br>
My research interest is:
*	Statistical Machine Learning
*	Probabilistic Models
*	Deep Neural Networks
*	Optimization
*	Probabilistic Graphical Model
*	Reinforcement Learning
*	Game Theory
* Natural Language Processing
