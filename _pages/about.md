I am Ali Mortazavi. I have finished my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at [CEIT department](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/home.htm?depurl=computer-engineering&lang=en) of [AmirKabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/).
<br> 



EDUCATION
======
> **BSc in Computer Engineering** <br>
> AmirKabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)
> * [CGPA](https://github.com/AliMorty/AliMorty.github.io/blob/master/files/Ali_Mortazavi_CV.pdf):   Overall         18.47 / 20 (3.78/4)
> * [Selected courses](https://alimorty.github.io//education/)   19.33 / 20 (4/4) <br>
                                                                  
RESEARCH INTEREST
======
In general, I am interested in applied mathematics, probability and statistics. 
I like to study how a human can understand concepts in a sequential manner and how we can **encode knowledge** in computers so they can infer like a human. Now, with the growth of Deep Learning Systems, I am really interested studying the **properties** of this networks and understanding what really Deep Neural Networks learn! 
I am also interested in how we can add some mechanism that **guaranty** that computers will be safe for human species.<br>
My research interest is: <br>
*	Statistical Machine Learning
*	Probabilistic Models
*	Deep Neural Networks
*	Optimization
*	Probabilistic Graphical Model
*	Reinforcement Learning
*	Game Theory
* Natural Language Processing
