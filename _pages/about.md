## Definition Lists

Definition List Title
:   Definition list division.

Startup
:   A startup company or startup is a company or temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.

#dowork
:   Coined by Rob Dyrdek and his personal body guard Christopher "Big Black" Boykins, "Do Work" works as a self motivator, to motivating your friends.

Do It Live
:   I'll let Bill O'Reilly [explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_HyZ5aW76c "We'll Do It Live") this one.


## Buttons

Make any link standout more when applying the `.btn` class.

## Notices

**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to a paragraph.
{: .notice}

## HTML Tags

### Address Tag

<address>
  1 Infinite Loop<br /> Cupertino, CA 95014<br /> United States
</address>

### Anchor Tag (aka. Link)

This is an example of a [link](http://github.com "Github").

### Abbreviation Tag

The abbreviation CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".

*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets

### Cite Tag

"Code is poetry." ---<cite>Automattic</cite>

### Code Tag

You will learn later on in these tests that `word-wrap: break-word;` will be your best friend.

### Strike Tag

This tag will let you <strike>strikeout text</strike>.

### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should _italicize_ text.

### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

### Keyboard Tag

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

### Preformatted Tag

This tag styles large blocks of code.

<pre>
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Strong Tag

This tag shows **bold text**.

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Superscript Tag

Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>.

RESEARCH INTEREST
======
In general, I am interested in applied mathematics, probability and statistics. 
I like to study how a human can **understand concepts** and how we can **encode knowledge** in computers so they can infer like a human. Now, with the growth of Deep Learning Systems, I am really interested in understanding what **really** Deep Neural Networks learn! 
I am also interested in how we can develop a **mechanism** to guarantee that computers will be safe for human species. <br>
My research interest is:
*	Statistical Machine Learning
*	Probabilistic Models
*	Deep Neural Networks
*	Optimization
*	Probabilistic Graphical Model
*	Reinforcement Learning
*	Game Theory
* Natural Language Processing

RESEARCH EXPERIENCES
======
> **Implementation and Evaluation of “Genetic” and “Simulated Annealing” Algorithms for Extended Travelling Salesman Problem** [GitHub](https://github.com/AliMorty/B.SC.-Project) <br>
> (**B.SC. Project**)<br>
> Under the supervision of [Dr. Razazi](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/~razzazi/)  at Amirkabir University of Technology <br>
> In this project, we tested the performance of two different heuristic approaches in solving an NP-Complete Problem. This problem is an extended version of Travelling Salesman Problem. Since our approach is heuristic, there is not guaranty to find a global optimum answer. So we needed some other exact approach for computing the global optimum. For this purpose, we reduced our problem to an Integer Linear Programming Instance. So in small graph samples, we could compare our results with optimum solution and for the large graph samples, we just compared our two different methods with each other.
