I am Ali Mortazavi. I finished my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at CEIT department of [AmirKabir University of Technology](https://alimorty.github.io//posts/2019-08-03-About-Amirkabir-University-of-Technology/) as a 3rd rank (out of 100 students). Having an interest in theoretical research, I decided to continue my study in the area of Algorithmic Game Theory. After reading lecture notes and books about Algorithmic Game Theory (which I described [here](https://alimorty.github.io//cv/)), I joined the [ITCS](http://itcs.shufe.edu.cn/people/) group at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE) as a visiting student to do research. <br>
Currently, I am working under the supervision of Prof. [Nick Gravin](http://itcs.shufe.edu.cn/~gravin/) and Prof. [Zhihao Gavin Tang](http://itcs.shufe.edu.cn/~zhtang/) and my current area of research is online stochastic matching.<br>

EDUCATION
======
> **BSc in Computer Engineering** <br>
> AmirKabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)
> * [CGPA](https://github.com/AliMorty/AliMorty.github.io/raw/master/files/Transcript_Ali_Mortazavi.pdf):   Overall         18.47 / 20 (3.78/4)
> * [Selected courses](https://alimorty.github.io//education/)   19.33 / 20 (4/4) <br>
                                                                  
RESEARCH INTEREST
======
In general, I am passionate about mathematics and theoretical computer science. I have experience in both algorithm design and probability and statistics in undergrad. After searching for a while, I found Game Theory to be very exciting, firstly because it is theory hence exciting and secondly because most of the questions that come to my mind during the day are related to some sort of applications of game theory. 
(i.e. understanding the selfish agents' behavior, finding a way to maximize the social welfare and maximizing the fairness, aggregating subjective preferences of a group, evolutionary equilibria in real life, price of anarchy when people use the best navigation app!-[here is a post about it](https://alimorty.github.io//posts/2019-08-12-Baraess-Paradox-and-Smartphone-Navigator-Applications/), etc.) <br>
As long as there is a nice theoretical question which I can do some progress on it, I am in! But let's list my interest here:<br>
* Algorithmic Game Theory
* Online (Stochastic) Algorithms (**currently doing research on it**)
* Mechanism Design
* Online Learning
* Property Testing
