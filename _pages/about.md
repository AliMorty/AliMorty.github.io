I am Ali Mortazavi. I have finished my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at [CEIT department](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/home.htm?depurl=computer-engineering&lang=en) of [AmirKabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/).
<br> 



EDUCATION
======
> **BSc in Computer Engineering** <br>
> AmirKabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)
> * [CGPA](https://github.com/AliMorty/AliMorty.github.io/raw/master/files/Mortazavi_All_Grades.pdf):   Overall         18.47 / 20 (3.78/4)
> * [Selected courses](https://alimorty.github.io//education/)   19.33 / 20 (4/4) <br>
                                                                  
RESEARCH INTEREST
======
In general, I am interested in applied mathematics, probability and statistics. I am also interested in algorithm design. <br>
I am interested in methods to guarantee the performance of model or finding a bound for performance of systems. With the growth of Deep Neural Networks, I am interested in research related to generalization in Deep Neural Networks. <br>
I am also interested to find a mechanism similar to mechanisms found in Game Theory to assure computers will be safe for human species. <br>
My research interests are: <br>

*	Statistical Machine Learning
*	Deep Neural Networks Robustness
*	Optimization
*	Mechanism Design in Game Theory
*	Encoding sequential information in Natural Language Processing
