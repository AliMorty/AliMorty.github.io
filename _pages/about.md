I am Ali Mortazavi. I've finished my undergraduate studies in Computer Science as a third rank at [CEIT department](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/home.htm?depurl=computer-engineering&lang=en) of [AmirKabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/).
<br> 




EDUCATION
======
> **BSc in Computer Engineering** <br>
> AmirKabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)
> * CGPA:   Overall         18.47 / 20   
> * CS courses   18.89 / 20 <br>




                                                                       

RESEARCH INTEREST
======
In general, I am interested in applied mathematics, probability and statistics. 
I like to study how a human can **understand concepts** and how we can **encode knowledge** in computers so they can infer like a human. Now, with the growth of Deep Learning Systems, I am really interested in understanding what **really** Deep Neural Networks learn! 
I am also interested in how we can develop a **mechanism** to guarantee that computers will be safe for human species. <br>
My research interest is:
*	Statistical Machine Learning
*	Probabilistic Models
*	Deep Neural Networks
*	Optimization
*	Probabilistic Graphical Model
*	Reinforcement Learning
*	Game Theory
* Natural Language Processing

RESEARCH EXPERIENCES
======
> **Implementation and Evaluation of “Genetic” and “Simulated Annealing” Algorithms for Extended Travelling Salesman Problem** [GitHub](https://github.com/AliMorty/B.SC.-Project) <br>
> (**B.SC. Project**)<br>
> Under the supervision of [Dr. Razazi](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/~razzazi/)  at Amirkabir University of Technology <br>
> In this project, we tested the performance of two different heuristic approaches in solving an NP-Complete Problem. This problem is an extended version of Travelling Salesman Problem. Since our approach is heuristic, there is not guaranty to find a global optimum answer. So we needed some other exact approach for computing the global optimum. For this purpose, we reduced our problem to an Integer Linear Programming Instance. So in small graph samples, we could compare our results with optimum solution and for the large graph samples, we just compared our two different methods with each other.
