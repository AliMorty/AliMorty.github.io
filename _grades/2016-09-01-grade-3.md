This graduate level course is based on Wassersman's **All of The Statistics** book. The first 14 Chapters of the book were covered. We have learned topics like: 
Different types of convergence, Parametric and Non Parametric learning, Boostrap technique for finding confidence interval, parameter inference and model selections.
