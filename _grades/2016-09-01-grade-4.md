This graduate level course is based on Koller's PGMs book. In representation part, inference part, and learning part of the book, the have learned mostly chapter 3-5, 9-13, and 17-18 respectively. 
Through this course, we have learned graphical representation and its properties, ways to estimate posterior distribution in reasonable time (e.g. MCMC), and how 
to predict parameters and graphical structures. I have audited this course.
