This course is taught by Dr.Heari. My main task was includes: <br>
* Creating and designing assignments 
* Conducting classes for students, in which extra content and concepts were presented. Such as:
** Probabilitic Cache Schedule Algorithms
** Naive Bayes Classifier as a simple example of PGMs
** Why we use MSE? Proofing that A Maximum Likelyhood Estimation with gussian noise is equal to minimzing the MSE
** Bootstrap as a way to estimate a Statistic and then construct a confidence interval.
** Random Walk

teach extra content for enthusiastic students. 
Assignments has two parts. 
> Questions<br>
> Computer Experiment<br>
#### Questions includes:
* Calculating Probabilities
* Proofing the property
* Modeling some real world example with our statistical tools
#### Computer Experiment  includes: 
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Sampling From a Distribution and Plotting corresponding Graphs
