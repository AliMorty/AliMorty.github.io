This course is taught by Dr.Heari. My main task includes: <br>
* Creating and designing assignments 
* Conducting classes for students, in which extra contents and concepts were presented. Such as:
    * A Probabilistic Cache Schedule Method
    * Naive Bayes Classifier as a simple example of PGMs
    * Why do we use MSE? Proofing that A Maximum Likelihood Estimation with Gaussian noise is equal to minimizing the MSE
    * Bootstrap as a way to estimate a Statistic and then construct a confidence interval.
    * Random Walk


Assignments have two parts. 
> Questions<br>
> Computer Experiments<br>
<br>

#### Questions includes:
* Calculating Probabilities
* Proofing the property
* Modeling some real world example with our statistical tools 
<br> <br>
#### Computer Experiment  includes: 
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Sampling From a Distribution and Plotting corresponding Graphs
