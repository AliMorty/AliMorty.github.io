There are several top universities in Tehran. There is always debates about their rank. But in computer science the most accepted ranking is as follows: <br>

1. Sharif University of Technology (SUT)
2. Tehran University (UT)
3. Amirkabir Univeristy (Tehran Polytechnic) (AUT)
4. Shahid Beheshti University (SBU)
5. Science and Technology 

Because of geographical barrier, there are not conferences and workshops here as much as other active counties. So the ranks corresponding to our universities are not really high. <br>
But considering this fact that most talented students in our Iran prefer to study computer science and computer engineering these days, we can conclude that students in these universities (with high probability) have a good cognitive abilities to do a great job in the graduate studies. <br>
To be concrete, let's explain the ratio a bit more: Each year, there is university entrance exam in which around 200,000 students participate. And only about 500 people can get admission to the above universities. And because of the growth of online material such as lecture notes, assignments, and resources, students here are able to use material from top universities. So in undergradute studies, I claim that there is not a significant difference between our universities and top universities aournd the world. But for graduate studies, I think this is not true firstly because in graduate level studies, the advisor plays a cruisal role. To motivate faculties to do great up-to-date research, we need to invest a huge amount of money, otherwise, professors pay less emphesize on their advisory roles and focus on more money making jobs. Because there is not much funding usually in Iran, we can not expect to bring great output here. The second reason is the distance. Actually there is not a lot of international conferences here in Iran, so we can access to new material just through the papers. Ofcourse there is a one year (or more) gap between a finding and its paper. So on average we are behind at least by 1 year. <br>
