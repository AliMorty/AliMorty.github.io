In this project, we want to extract important sentences that can summarize the whole text.
We used Page Rank Algorithm for determining the importance of each sentence. In this algorithm, we consider every sentence in the text as a node and then we have to determine the relationship between nodes. To find the relation between each sentence (nodes in the page rank graph), we used word2vec.
